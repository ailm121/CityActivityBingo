# CityActivityBingo

## Introduction
This is an Android application for a bingo based game. In the game the purpose is to complete randomly assigned tasks in a bingo grid. The game is designed to be played by 2-4 teams at a time and game area can be limited to a finnish town, region or the whole country. Available areas are determined by the task pool. Using smaller grids guarantees more variability in areas and tasks. 

Note that this application is not completely finished and contains some bugs and issues. However, it is currently functional.
